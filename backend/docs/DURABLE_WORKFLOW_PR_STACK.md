# Durable Workflow PR Stack

Status: working stack
Date: 2026-06-27

This stack is ordered for upstream review. PR 1-5 is the first community-visible
milestone: existing DeerFlow run APIs keep their current behavior, but each run
also has durable workflow identity, idempotency, lifecycle events, and an
inspectable trace.

The roadmap continues beyond the runtime layer because durable workflow
identity is most useful when operators can assign, observe, and recover real
work. The follow-up module track keeps that product value visible while
preserving the runtime boundary:

- runtime core PRs make every run/workflow traceable and recoverable;
- Work Module PRs add generic Work Units that can map to Jira, ClickUp, Plane,
  Trello, Lark, GitHub Issues, or internal PM tools;
- WorkBoard PRs add a built-in Kanban surface for teams that do not already
  have a PM system connected;
- workflow design PRs add authoring/versioning for repeatable agent workflows
  after the runtime and work primitives are stable.

Draft upstream PRs currently opened from this roadmap:

- #3813: runtime architecture docs.
- #3814: durable workflow store/schema/events.
- #3815: workflow read APIs and timeline projection.
- #3816: run wrapper and workflow trace binding.
- #3817: generic Work Module core.
- #3818: agent-facing Work Unit tools.
- #3819: WorkBoard MVP.

## Review Principles

- Keep the Durable Workflow Runtime layer generic. Do not introduce AICOS, PM
  tool, visual designer, board, or external-orchestrator concepts into that
  runtime layer.
- Keep module boundaries explicit. Durable Workflow Runtime, Work Module, and
  WorkBoard are separately gated by `modules.*` config and should not require
  each other except for WorkBoard depending on the Work Module API.
- LangGraph remains owner of graph execution, checkpoint state, graph-local
  memory, interrupts, and resume semantics.
- DeerFlow owns intake identity, workflow status projection, idempotency,
  run/checkpoint references, channel/API routing, and runtime observability.
- StreamBridge backends own live run-event delivery to connected clients.
  Durable workflow state should not depend on a particular StreamBridge backend.
- The optional DeerFlow Work Module may map workflow ids to generic Work Units,
  and external adapters may map those Work Units to domain task/card/issue
  systems. Those mappings live outside this runtime stack.

## Redis StreamBridge Alignment

The Redis StreamBridge proposals in upstream discussion address a different
layer from this durable workflow runtime stack. They make live run streaming
work across multiple gateway workers by moving `StreamBridge` from an
in-process queue to Redis Streams. That is a runtime transport and reconnect
improvement, not a canonical workflow ledger.

The durable workflow layer remains compatible with either `memory` or `redis`
StreamBridge:

- `StreamBridge` delivers recent run events to SSE clients and may use bounded
  retention, replay cursors, TTLs, and terminal reconciliation.
- `RunEventStore` remains the durable low-level run event source.
- `WorkflowStore` and `workflow_events` remain the durable intake, identity,
  lifecycle, idempotency, and recovery projection.
- Workflow timelines merge workflow events with `RunEventStore` rows at query
  time instead of copying Redis stream entries.

If a Redis StreamBridge lands before this stack, the run wrapper PR should
rebase around gateway service and thread-run router changes, preserve
cross-process stream capability checks, and continue to treat Redis Streams as
an optional live transport. If the durable workflow stack lands first, Redis
StreamBridge can be added underneath it without changing workflow schema.

## PR 1: Runtime Architecture And Shared Contracts

Purpose: align vocabulary before schema and API changes.

Scope:

- Add `DURABLE_WORKFLOW_RUNTIME_PLAN.md`.
- Add `DURABLE_WORKFLOW_FRONTDOOR.md`.
- Link both docs from the backend docs index.
- Define shared identity names: `workflow_id`, `workflow_event_id`,
  `thread_id`, `run_id`, `checkpoint_ns`, `checkpoint_id`,
  `workflow_definition_id`, and `workflow_run_id`.
- Define status and event contracts.

Acceptance:

- No runtime behavior changes.
- Docs clearly separate runtime workflow identity from future visual workflow
  definitions and future work unit modules.

Suggested checks:

```bash
git diff --check
```

## PR 2: Workflow Envelope Schema And Store

Purpose: persist the minimal durable frontdoor envelope.

Scope:

- Add runtime workflow enums and `WorkflowStore`.
- Add in-memory workflow store.
- Add SQLAlchemy workflow repository.
- Add `workflows` ORM model and migration.
- Wire gateway dependency so production uses SQL store when a DB session
  factory exists, otherwise memory store.

Acceptance:

- `create_or_get` dedupes by `(source_type, source, idempotency_key)`.
- Store supports `get`, `list`, `bind_runtime`, `update_status`,
  `claim_next`, and `release_for_retry`.
- Existing run APIs still behave the same before wrapper adoption.

Suggested checks:

```bash
cd backend
PYTHONPATH=. PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run pytest \
  tests/test_workflow_repository.py \
  tests/test_persistence_bootstrap.py \
  tests/test_persistence_bootstrap_concurrency.py \
  tests/test_persistence_bootstrap_regression.py \
  tests/test_persistence_scaffold.py -q
```

## PR 3: Workflow Events

Purpose: add append-only lifecycle facts for audit and recovery decisions.

Scope:

- Add `workflow_events` ORM model and migration.
- Add `append_event` and `list_events` to workflow stores.
- Keep workflow events separate from `RunEventStore`.
- Ensure migrations are idempotent when legacy `create_all` already created
  tables.

Acceptance:

- Event `seq` is monotonic per workflow.
- Events can exist before a run exists.
- No checkpoint values are copied into workflow event rows.

Suggested checks:

```bash
cd backend
PYTHONPATH=. PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run pytest \
  tests/test_workflow_repository.py \
  tests/test_workflows_router.py \
  tests/test_persistence_bootstrap.py \
  tests/test_persistence_bootstrap_concurrency.py \
  tests/test_persistence_bootstrap_regression.py -q
```

## PR 4: Durable Run Trace API And UI

Purpose: make the runtime value visible without requiring WorkBoard, PM
adapters, or an external workflow engine.

Scope:

- Add read-only workflow endpoints:
  - `GET /api/workflows`
  - `GET /api/workflows/{workflow_id}`
  - `GET /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/events`
  - `GET /api/workflows/by-run/{run_id}`
  - `GET /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/timeline`
- Timeline merges workflow lifecycle events and run events at query time.
- Add a compact workspace Trace trigger for the latest run in a chat.

Acceptance:

- A user can open a chat and inspect the latest run trace.
- A developer can find `workflow_id` from `run_id`.
- Timeline includes both workflow events and existing run events.
- Endpoint additions do not change existing run API responses.

Suggested checks:

```bash
cd backend
PYTHONPATH=. PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run pytest \
  tests/test_workflows_router.py \
  tests/test_gateway_services.py -q

cd ../frontend
CI=true pnpm run check
```

## PR 5: Run API Wrapper And Status Projection

Purpose: route existing run creation through workflow intake while preserving
client compatibility.

Scope:

- Wrap `/api/runs/*` and `/api/threads/{thread_id}/runs*` creation paths.
- Create a workflow envelope before run creation.
- Bind `thread_id`, `run_id`, `checkpoint_ns`, and `checkpoint_id`.
- Project run lifecycle to workflow status:
  - `running`
  - `succeeded`
  - `failed`
  - `cancelled`
- Append lifecycle events:
  - `workflow.received`
  - `workflow.deduped`
  - `workflow.run_created`
  - `workflow.run_started`
  - `workflow.succeeded`
  - `workflow.failed`
  - `workflow.cancelled`

Acceptance:

- Old clients can ignore workflows entirely.
- Duplicate idempotency keys do not create duplicate bound runs.
- Workflow terminal status matches the bound run terminal status.
- Trace UI shows terminal status on new runs.

Suggested checks:

```bash
cd backend

## Post-Milestone PRs

These should come after PR 1-5, so the foundation is already visible and
testable.

### PR 6: Recovery And Orphan Reconciliation

- Reconcile active workflows with existing run reconciliation at gateway
  startup.
- Mark `running` / `run_created` workflows as `orphaned` when process-local
  execution was lost.
- Add recovery hints in timeline responses.

### PR 7: Deterministic Binding Resolver

- Normalize explicit thread/run/checkpoint/source bindings.
- Persist ambiguous candidates instead of guessing.
- Give channel adapters a generic binding contract.

### PR 8: Channel And Dashboard Intake Adoption

- Route Slack/Discord/Telegram-style adapters through workflow intake.
- Use stable external message ids as idempotency keys.
- Keep channel UX compatible.

### PR 9: Durable Waiting And Resume Refs

- Represent LangGraph interrupt waits as durable workflow state.
- Route resume commands through workflow intake.
- Keep actual interrupt payloads in LangGraph checkpoint state.

### PR 10: Worker Pool Readiness

- Add worker identity and lease renewal.

- Keep gateway process execution as the default mode.

## Next Module Tracks

The following tracks should remain separate from the runtime PRs:

- Work Module: generic Work Unit records and external PM mappings.
- WorkBoard: built-in board UI for deployments without a PM tool.
- Workflow Designer: visual workflow definition authoring and versioning.
- Optional orchestrator adapters: Restate, Temporal, Hatchet integration
  examples, not hard dependencies.

## Module PRs After Runtime

These PRs depend on the runtime identity/event foundation but should not be
required for a minimal durable runtime deployment.

### PR 11: Work Module Schema And API

Current draft: #3817.

- Add `DEERFLOW_WORK_MODULE.md`.

- Add `/api/work-units` CRUD and event list endpoints.
- Allow optional links to `workflow_id`, `thread_id`, and `run_id`.

### PR 12: WorkBoard MVP

Current draft: #3819.

- Add `/workspace/work`.
- Show Trello-style columns over `work_units.status`.
- Create local work units.
- Show runtime-driven status projection; local human-created work starts in
  `backlog`.
- Link cards to chat threads and workflow traces when refs exist.

  such as a stack of upstream PRs, can be represented as Work Units assigned
  to agents and tracked through backlog, ready, running, waiting, review, done,
  and closed states.
